## Badge Storage Structure

Badges are stored as JSON files in the `kit/badges/` directory:

```json
{
  "name": "badge-name",
  "title": "Display Title",
  "description": "Badge description",
  "color": "#hexcolor",
  "created": "ISO timestamp",
  "ceremonies": [
    {
      "id": "ceremony_id",
      "userId": "discord_user_id",
      "grantedBy": "granter_user_id", 
      "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
      "ceremony": "ceremony_type"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Integration with Role System

Badges can be automatically affixed during role-granting ceremonies by specifying the badge parameter:

```bash
node kit/scripts/grant-role.js grant <guild> <user> <role> <granter> <badgeName>
```

## Ceremonial Significance

Each badge represents not just an achievement, but a ceremonial milestone that connects the bearer to the shrine's ongoing legacy. The badge system maintains detailed records of each affixing ceremony, creating a permanent record in the shrine's ledger.
